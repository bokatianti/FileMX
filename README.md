# FileMX
Fake Microsoft Office files generator.
It is a simple cpp program, to get away with forgotten homework documents,worksheets and presentations. 
When the teacher tries to open it, you can say it isn't your fault that it gets an error message.
It also has a custom mode, when you can set the filename and the extension.
You can also set (in all modes) the output filesize in exact kilobytes.
You can find the first GitHub release precompiled at the "Precompiled 1.4.2.0" Branch
